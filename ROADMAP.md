# Vehicle Document System - Development Roadmap

## âœ… PHASE 1: PREPROCESSING COMPLETE (v1.0)
- [x] Environment setup (Python 3.10.12 + ML stack)
- [x] Multi-source data exploration (4 datasets analyzed)
- [x] OpenCV preprocessing pipeline
- [x] Data augmentation for class balancing  
- [x] Train/val/test splits (729 samples, 3 classes)
- [x] Balance ratio: 29:1 â†’ 5.9:1 (major improvement)

## ðŸ”„ PHASE 2: MODEL TRAINING (Current)
- [ ] 03_model_training.ipynb creation
- [ ] CNN architecture design (TensorFlow/Keras)
- [ ] Multi-class classification training
- [ ] Model evaluation and metrics analysis
- [ ] Hyperparameter tuning

## ðŸ“‹ PHASE 3: ADVANCED ML (Planned)
- [ ] Transfer learning experiments
- [ ] OCR pipeline integration
- [ ] Model optimization (pruning, quantization)
- [ ] Cross-validation analysis
- [ ] Error analysis and model improvement

## ðŸš€ PHASE 4: DEPLOYMENT (Future)
- [ ] AWS SageMaker integration
- [ ] Lambda functions for inference
- [ ] FastAPI development
- [ ] Docker containerization
- [ ] Production monitoring setup

## ðŸ“Š PROJECT METRICS
- **Dataset**: 729 samples (licence: 471, odometer: 178, document: 80)
- **Balance**: 5.9:1 ratio (acceptable for training)
- **Processing**: 64 augmented samples for minority class
- **Quality**: Professional MLOps structure with metadata tracking

## ðŸŽ¯ IMMEDIATE NEXT STEP
Create `03_model_training.ipynb` with:
1. Data loading from processed splits
2. CNN model architecture 
3. Multi-class classification training
4. Comprehensive evaluation metrics
